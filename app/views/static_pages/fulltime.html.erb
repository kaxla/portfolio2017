<div class="fulltime-header">I'm Going Full-Time!</div>

<div class="fulltime-blurb">I've been freelancing for 3 years, but now Iâ€™m looking to bring
my unique understanding of customer needs and my passion for Fullstack
development to a full-time permanent, contract, or contract-to-hire role.
Ideally I would like to work remotely, but I'm also considering positions
in Seattle in the SODO, Pioneer Square, Downtown, or South Lake Union neighborhoods.</div>
